# Emerging Networks Architectures


This project focused on the development of an algorithm cappable of efficiently exchanging information on delay tollerant networks (DTNs).

The group was challenged to do such work in the Masters in Computer Engineering course of Emerging Networks Architectures.

It was also developed a testing environment from wich you can try the project. (Use CORE emulator in order for it to work properly)
